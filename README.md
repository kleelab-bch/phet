## Basic Description

This repo contains an implementation of U-Het (**U**nraveling cellular **Het**erogeneity by analyzing intra-cellular variation) [XXX]

## Dependencies

The codebase is tested to work under Python 3.9. To install the necessary requirements, run the following commands:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Basically, *U-Het* requires following packages:

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (>= 1.15)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (>= 0.20)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (>= 0.23)
